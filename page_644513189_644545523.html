Miss, This is information about “Coomassie Brilliant Blue”<br />
Coomassie Brilliant Blue is the name of two similar triphenylmethane dyes that were developed for use in the textile industry but are now commonly used for staining proteins in analytical biochemistry. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 differs from Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 by the addition of two methyl groups. The name "Coomassie" is a registered trademark of Imperial Chemical Industries.<br />
1.	Name and discovery<br />
The name Coomassie was adopted at the end of the 19th century as a trade name by the Blackley based dye manufacturer Levinstein Ltd, in marketing a range of acid wool dyes. In 1896 during the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War, British forces had occupied the town of Coomassie (modern-day Kumasi in Ghana). In 1918 Levinstein Ltd became part of British Dyestuffs which in 1926 became part of Imperial Chemical Industries. Although ICI still owns the Coomassie trademark, the company no longer manufactures the dyes. The blue disulfonated triphenylmethane dyes were first produced in 1913 by Max Weiler who was based in Elberfeld, Germany. Various patents were subsequently taken out on the organic synthesis.<br />
2.	Dye colour<br />
The suffix "R" in the name of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 is an abbreviation for Red as the blue colour of the dye has a slight reddish tint. For the "G" variant the blue colour has a more greenish tint. The "250" originally denoted the purity of the dye.<br />
The colour of the two dyes depends on the acidity of the solution. The "G" form of the dye has been studied in detail. At a pH of less than 0 the dye has a red colour with an absorption maximum at a wavelength of 470 nm. At a pH of around 1 the dye is green with an absorption maximum at 620 nm while above pH 2 the dye is bright blue with a maximum at 595 nm. At pH 7 the dye has an extinction coefficient of 43,000 M-1cm-1.<br />
The different colours are a result of the different charged states of the dye molecule. In the red form, all three nitrogen atoms carry a positive charge. The two sulfonic acid groups have extremely low pKa's and will normally be negatively charged, thus at a pH of around zero the dye will be a cation with an overall charge of 1. The green colour corresponds to a form of the dye with no net overall charge. At neutral pH (pH 7), only the nitrogen atom of the diphenylamine moiety carries a positive charge and the blue dye molecule is an anion with an overall charge of -1. The pKa's for the loss of the two protons are 1.15 and 1.82. The final proton is lost under alkaline conditions and the dye becomes pink in colour (pKa 12.4).<br />
The dye molecules bind to proteins including wool (keratin) to form a protein-dye complex. The formation of the complex stabilises the negatively charged anionic form of the dye producing the blue colour, even under acid conditions when most of the molecules in solution are in the cationic form. This is the basis of the Bradford assay which is used to quantify the concentration of protein in a solution.<br />
3.	Applications in biochemistry<br />
<br />
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was first used to visualise proteins in 1963 by Fazekas de St. Groth and colleagues. Protein samples were separated electrophoretically on a cellulose acetate sheet. The sheet was then soaked in sulfosalicylic acid to fix the protein bands and then transferred to a solution of the dye.<br />
<br />
Two years later in 1965 Meyer and Lambert used Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to stain protein samples after electrophoretic separation in a polyacrylamide gel. They soaked the gel in a dye solution containing methanol, acetic acid and water. As the dye stained the polyacrylamide gel as well as the protein, to visualise the protein bands they needed to destained the gel which they did electrophoretically.<br />

Chemistry<br />
It is a synthetic dye produced using aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum. It can be combined with tartrazine (E102) to produce various shades of green.<br />
It is usually a disodium salt. The diammonium salt has CAS number [2650-18-2]. Calcium and potassium salts are also permitted. It can also appear as an aluminium lake.<br />
The chemical formation is C37H34N2Na2O9S3. The dye is poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and 95% of the ingested dye can be found in the feces.<br />
It also reacts with certain bile pigments to form green feces.<br />
Applications<br />
As a blue color, Brilliant Blue FCF is often found in ice cream, canned processed peas, dairy products, sweets and drinks. It is also used in soaps, shampoos, mouthwash and other hygiene and cosmetics applications. In soil science, Brilliant Blue is applied in tracing studies to visualize infiltration and water distribution in the soil.<br />
Health and safety<br />
Brilliant Blue FCF has previously been banned in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland among others but has been certified as a safe food additive in the EU and is today legal in most of the countries. It has the capacity for inducing an allergic reaction in individuals with pre-existing moderate asthma. In the United States production exceeds 1 million pounds annually, and daily consumption is around 16 mg per person.<br />
It is one of the colorants that the Hyperactive Children's Support Group and the Feingold Association recommends to be eliminated from the diet of children. After extensive testing, the National Institutes of Health concluded that color additives do not cause hyperactivity. <br />
Biomedical research<br />
Scientists who were investigating the use of compounds to lessen the severity of inflammation following spinal cord injury had previously tested a compound called OxATP to block a key ATP receptor in spinal neurons. However, OxATP has toxic side effects and must be injected directly into the spinal cord; in searching for alternatives they noted that Brilliant Blue FCF has a similar structure. This led them to test a related dye, Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassie Brilliant Blue in rats, which improved recovery from spinal cord injury (note that the Wired magazine article is inaccurate since it states that FD&C Blue No. 1 (Brilliant Blue FCF) was the dye that was actually tested in rats, rather than Brilliant Blue G.) <br />

<li style="background-color:#c3d2f0;"><p>Erythrosine, also known as Red No. 3, is an organoiodine compound, specifically a derivative of fluorone. It is cherry-pink synthetic, primarily used for food coloring.[1] It is the disodium salt of 2,4,5,7-tetraiodofluorescein. Its maximum absorbance is at 530 nm[2] in an aqueous solution, and it is subject to photodegradation.[citation needed]<br />

<br />
[edit] Uses<br />
It is used as a food coloring, in printing inks, as a biological stain, a dental plaque disclosing agent and a radiopaque medium. Erythrosine is commonly used in sweets such as some candies and popsicles, and even more widely used in cake-decorating gels. It is also used to color pistachio shells.[3][4] As a food additive, it has the E number E127.<br />
While commonly in most countries of the world, erythrosine is less commonly used in the United States with Allura Red AC (Red #40) being generally used instead. However, Allura Red AC is banned in many European countries because it is an azo dye, despite the fact that it has fewer known health risks than erythrosine.[citation needed]<br />
As a result of efforts begun in the 1970s, in 1990 the U.S. FDA had instituted a partial ban on erythrosine, citing research that high doses have been found to cause cancer in rats.[5] In June of 2008, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) petitioned the FDA for a complete ban on erythrosine in the United States.[6]<br />

In some developed countries, preservatives and dyes of this type are very limited in its use. Preservatives and food coloring is only allowed to be used on foods that are only consumed by adults such as alcohol, ink tattoos, and drugs. If a person consumes food containing potassium nitrite, the nitrite in the stomach will turn into nitrosoamine which is a carcinogenic substance. Allura red in feed materials can damage the nervous system in the human brain.in Indonesia, actually had to make regulations to deal with the excess use of two materials by the manufacturer but some factors such as high cost of replacement materials to make the producers sometimes perform fraudulent acts. In fact, food manufacturers can use potassium sorbate as a preservative because of its use very small negative effect and natural dyes are more secure.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

<li style="background-color:#c3d2f0;"><p>Edible Shellac (Glazing Agent)<br />
<br />
Shellac is soluble in alkaline solutions such as ammonia, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide, and also in various organic solvents. When dissolved in alcohol, typically blends containing ethanol and methanol, shellac yields a coating of superior durability and hardness and is available in numerous grades. Shellac refined for industrial purposes either retains its natural wax content or is refined wax-free by filtration.<br />
<br />
Shellac is edible and is used as a glazing agent on pills and candies. Because of its alkaline properties, shellac-coated pills may be used for a timed enteric or colonic release. It is also used to replace the natural wax of the apple, which is removed during the cleaning process. [8] When used for this purpose, it has the food additive E number E904. This coating may not be considered as vegetarian as it may, and probably does, contain crushed insects. In the tablet manufacture trade, it is sometimes referred to as “beetlejuice” for this reason. In some cases, shellac is known to cause allergies on contact, resulting in skin irritations. [9<br />
<br />
Any edible food film composition providing the above attributes can be used herein, e.g., conventional shellac. Especially suitable compositions, composition preparation and application techniques for use as the film layers are disclosed in Seaborne et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,661,359, issued Apr. 28, 1987, entitled EDIBLE COATING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ACID CATALYZED SHELLAC AND HYROXYPROPYL CELLULOSE AND METHOD OF PREPARATION, and U.S. Pat. No. 788,178, filed Oct. 16, 1985, now Seaborne et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,228, entitled EDIBLE COATING COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PREPARATION, each of which are incorporated herein by reference. The coatings there described in detail are polymers of a specially defined, shellac or copolymers of the shellac with certain other reactants having a reactive acid or hydroxyl moiety.<br />
<br />
The specification of edible shellac should not be construed as a limitation of the present invention. Other glazing materials may be use, such as glazing agents, or polishing agents, are food additives providing shiny appearance or protective coating to foods. Mostly they are based on waxes. Examples of other possible glazing agents are: stearic acid, beeswax candelilla wax, microcrystalline wax, lanolin, oxidized polyethelyne wax and esters of colophonium. <br />

<br />
Food additives are substances added intentionally to food in small quantities, with the aim to improve the appearance, taste, texture, flavor and extend shelf life. Moreover, it can improve the nutritional value such as protein, minerals and vitamins. The use of food additives have been used since ancient times. There are two food additives, food additives are natural and artificial or synthetic.<br />
<br />
Food additives are substances that are not naturally a part of foodstuffs, but there is in food ingredients such as treatment during processing, storage or packaging.<br />
<br />
 For food available in the form presented a more attractive, taste, appearance and good consistency and durable so often, the addition of food additives are often called chemical additives (food aditiva). Sometimes food is available does not have an attractive shape despite the high nutritional content.<br />
<br />
On this website, we will explain about the food coloring. The addition of dyes in foods intended to make food more interesting. Dye itself is widely used around the world. In Indonesia, since the first people to use traditional food coloring derived from natural materials, such as saffron for yellow, suji leaf to leaf green and pink to red. Natural dyes are safe to eat but has a weakness, namely its availability is limited, and the color is not homogeneous, so not suitable for food and beverage industry. The use of natural materials for bulk products will increase production costs become more expensive and more difficult because of the nature of natural dyes are not homogeneous so hard to produce a stable color.<br />
<br />
Technological advances allow food dyes are made synthetically. In small amounts, some chemicals can give a stable color in food products. Thus, producers could use more color options to attract consumers. Synthetic dyes have been through an intensive testing to ensure safety. Characteristics of synthetic dyes are brighter colors, more homogeneous and have more color variation when compared with natural dyes. Consumers also should always get NFORMATION about the components contained in these synthetic dyes.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

<br />
Description<br />
<br />
Shellac is a natural, organic resin that is secreted by the female lac beetle (Laccifera lacca) on trees found in India and Thailand. The secreted resin forms a cocoon where the insect incubates the eggs she lays. The cocoon and parts of the bark are scraped off, crushed, washed, filtered, and dried to form yellow/orange flakes, often bleached white for commercial use as a glazing agentProvide a protective coating or shiny appearance to foods..<br />
Common Uses<br />
<br />
Due to it's high glossy finish on relatively thin coatings, Shellac is used in coatings for hard candies and in chocolate. It is also used as a wax on apples and other fruits, to make them look shinier and more appealing.<br />

Shellac is derived from the excretions of the Kerria lacca insect, most commonly found in the forests of Thailand.<br />
<br />
The Kerria lacca uses the sticky excretion as a means to stick to the trees on which it lives. Candy makers use it to make those treats you love so much shiny and beautiful. Then you eat them. The insects that is.<br />
<br />
You see, the process used to harvest the Kerria lacca excretion is a pretty simple one. They just scrape that right off the tree. Unfortunately for you and your future enjoyment of shiny candies, this leaves little room for quality control measures to guarantee that the insects themselves aren't scooped up also.<br />
Once that happens, and it almost always does, the insect simply becomes part of the shellac-making process. And the candy-making process. And the candy-eating process.<br />
<br />
Before some health nut out there pipes up to tell us they don't eat candy, we'd like to point out that, during the cleaning process, apples lose their natural shine. Care to guess how it's restored?<br />
<br />
If all of this is making you a bit queasy, we understand. It's not every day that you find out you've been celebrating the resurrection of Christ by consuming handfuls of insect-infused treats your entire life. But before you head to the medicine cabinet, consider this. That pill you want to take to quell your nausea? It didn't get shiny on its own. Alright, we swear, this is the last time we'll mention that you've been eating insects for a good majority of your life.<br />

<li style="background-color:#c3d2f0;"><p>Shellac is a resin secreted by the female lac bug, on trees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured at right), which are dissolved in denatured alcohol to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish. Shellac functions as a tough all-natural primer, sanding sealant, tannin-blocker, odor-blocker, stain, and high-gloss varnish. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses good insulation qualities and it seals out moisture. Phonograph(gramophone) records were also made of it during the pre-1950s, 78-rpm recording era.<br />
<br />
Shellac is often the only historically appropriate finish for early 20th-century hardwood floors, and wooden wall and ceiling paneling.<br />
<br />
From the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, shellac was the dominant wood finish in the western world until it was replaced by nitrocellulose lacquer in the 1920s and 1930s.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>
<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p>Lecithin was first identified in 1846 by Maurice Gobley, a French chemist. It is the name for a mixture of phospholipids, an important component of food products, occurring both naturally and added as a supplement. The body breaks down lecithin into choline, phosphate, glycerol, and fatty acids.<br />
<br />
Lecithin is found naturally in a number of items used for food, including egg yolk, fish, grains, legumes, peanuts, soybeans, wheat germ, and yeast. It is also used in food preparation to create products such as baked goods, chocolate, margarine, and mayonnaise because of its ability to moisturize, preserve, and emulsify. It is a key ingredient in cooking spray—the substance used to replace oils, margarine, and butter in sautéing and baking.<br />

Tartrazine is a synthetic yellow azo dye derived from coal tar and has been banned in several countries (Austria, Norway) because of serious side effects such as causing potentially lethal asthma attacks and nettle rash, hives, DNA damage, tumors of the thyroid and ADHD. <br />
<br />
Other dangers of Tartrazine are anxiety attacks, itching, rhinitis, urticaria, general weakness, heatwaves, migraine, clinical depression, blurred vision, palpitations, feeling of suffocation, pruritus, purple skin patches and sleep disturbance. In rare cases, Tartrazine side effects are noticeable even at minute doses and can last up to 72 hours after exposure.<br />

<li style="background-color:#c3d2f0;"><p>Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic, or sour, taste to foods and soft drinks. In biochemistry, it is important as an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and therefore occurs in the metabolism of virtually all living things. It can also be used as an environmentally benign cleaning agent.<br />
Citric acid exists in greater than trace amounts in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably citrus fruits. Lemons and limes have particularly high concentrations of the acid; it can constitute as much as 8% of the dry weight of these fruits (about 47 g/L in the juices[3]). The concentrations of citric acid in citrus fruits range from 0.005 mol/L for oranges and grapefruits to 0.30 mol/L in lemons and limes. Within species these values vary depending on the cultivar and the circumstances in which the fruit was grown.<br />

<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p>what is Methyl P-Hydroxybenzoate it?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Agency U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as reported by eHow, Monday (11/10/2010) include Methyl P-Hydroxybenzoate as safe preservatives.<br />
<br />
This material is allowed to be used in cosmetic products, pharmaceutical products or medicines and food products.<br />
<br />
1. Use for cosmetics<br />
For more than 80 years, the methyl has been used as preservatives in cosmetics industry are often found in facial moisturizer, anti-aging products, hair dyes, skin whitening products, shaving gel, facial cleanser, spray, shampoo and conditioner, mascara, eye shadow and foundation.<br />
<br />
2. The use for pharmaceutical<br />
In the pharmaceutical industry, methyl has been used to protect the drug since 1924. Methyl used for anti-bacterial such as topical antibiotics, corticosteroids and eye drops. Some antibiotics such as penicillin prevents the use of methylparaben in contamination of microorganisms.<br />
<br />
3. Use for food<br />
Because of its anti-fungal, methyl is used as an inhibitor of yeast in food products. The FDA said the product is safe to use in small quantities. In food methyl was found in frozen dairy products, oils and fats, jams, syrups and spices.<br />
<br />
As a food preservative, the FDA classifies the methylparaben in the category of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). That is, these chemicals can and safe for use on most food products.<br />
<br />
As a food preservative, methylparaben has advantages over other preservatives are water soluble. Therefore, these compounds are often used because it is considered more secure when involved in contact with liquid.<br />
<br />
Another plus, methylparaben not only prevent the growth of bacteria in an instant and preserved food. Moreover, these compounds can also help maintain a sense of stability so that food can be stored in a longer time.<br />
<br />
In the body, these compounds are also relatively safe because it is easily metabolized. Because the easily absorbed, either through the digestive tract and skin, these compounds are also released faster from the body.<br />
<br />
In use for cosmetics, methylparaben although rarely cause irritation can trigger allergies in some people. These compounds are classified as non-toxic compound, which is not toxic even if absorbed through the skin surface as well as digestion.<br />
<br />
Although there are some findings about the dangers of methyl but until now these findings has not been fully tested. Cosmetic Safety Database Research methyl has been associated with cancer, allergies, endocrine disorders, poisoning or cellular level changes. But this discovery still to be proved.<br />
<br />
While several studies have shown methyl can react with ultraviolet B exposure resulting in increased DNA damage and aging skin. However, as affirmed by the FDA over the amount used does not exceed the dosage is quite safe product.<br />

<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p> i wanna explain you about    monosodium glutamat (MSG) :<br />
<br />
What is MSG ?<br />
<br />
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the sodium salt of the naturally occurring amino acid, glutamic acid which makes up 10 to 25 % of all food protein, from both animal and vegetable sources. In addition to being an ingredient intentionally added to foods, glutamate occurs as a natural part of proteins, including vegetable and animal proteins. These proteins, when broken down (i.e.: by cooking) release free glutamate and are themselves used as ingredients in various prepared meat products, soups, broths and gravy mixes.<br />
<br />
Is monosodium glutamate a food additive?<br />
<br />
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is not regulated as a food additive. It is considered a flavour enhancing ingredient used to enhance the natural flavour of various foods. While there is no regulatory limit to the amount of MSG that may be added to food, the amount of MSG added should be at levels consistent with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). In other words, only the smallest amount needed to enhance the flavour should be added to the food.<br />
Is MSG safe?<br />
<br />
In general, the use of MSG is not a health hazard to consumers. The safety of MSG has been reviewed by regulatory authorities and scientists worldwide, including Health Canada. However, some individuals who consume MSG may exhibit an allergic-type reaction or hypersensitivity. For those people, the effects of consuming food containing MSG may include: a burning sensation, facial pressure, headache, nausea and chest pains appearing about 20 minutes after consumption and disappearing about two hours later. Such reactions have generally been reported to be temporary and not associated with severe adverse health effects. People sensitive enough to be affected are advised to avoid the use of this substance.<br />
Are there other sources of glutamate in food?<br />
<br />
Consumers may believe that MSG is the sole source of glutamates, and thus the only source of concern to sensitive individuals who may react to glutamates. However, any foods that are inherently high sources of free glutamates may also be of concern to sensitive individuals. The Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) 1 , in its report on adverse reactions to monosodium glutamate, concluded that there is no difference in the physiological response to synthesized and natural glutamates.<br />
Other claims about the safety of MSG<br />
<br />
The safety of MSG has been studied worldwide. The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations / World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (1987), and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (1995) conducted thorough evaluations and concluded that the use of MSG does not constitute a health hazard to consumers. Health Canada scientists concur with these views. In addition, there is no scientific evidence linking obesity in humans with the consumption of foods containing MSG. Nevertheless, some individuals may exhibit an allergic-type reaction or hypersensitivity when exposed to MSG. For those who suffer from this sensitivity, avoiding MSG is recommended.<br />

*Relevant plant sources<br />
<br />
A variety of plants have provided indigo throughout history, but most natural indigo was obtained from those in the genus Indigofera, which are native to the tropics. The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo (Indigofera tinctoria, also known as Indigofera sumatrana). In Central and South America the two species Indigofera suffruticosa (Añil) and Indigofera arrecta (Natal indigo) were the most important. In temperate climates indigo can also be obtained from woad (Isatis tinctoria) and dyer's knotweed (Polygonum tinctorum), although the Indigofera species yield more dye.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

<li style="background-color:#c3d2f0;"><p>Synthetic uses<br />
Uses of chlorine include PVC, pesticides and epoxy resins. Industrially, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. Along with chlorine, this chloralkali process yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide, according to the chemical equation<br />
2 NaCl + 2 H2O → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH<br />
Sodium metal is produced commercially through the electrolysis of liquid sodium chloride. This is now done in a Down's cell in which sodium chloride is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700 °C. As calcium is more electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be formed at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous method of electrolyzing sodium hydroxide.<br />
Sodium chloride is used in other chemical processes for the large-scale production of compounds containing sodium or chlorine. In the Solvay process, sodium chloride is used for producing sodium carbonate and calcium chloride. In the Mannheim process and in the Hargreaves process, it is used for the production of sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>
<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p>Production and use<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Modern rock salt mine near Mount Morris, New York, United States<br />
Salt is currently mass-produced by evaporation of seawater or brine from other sources, such as brine wells and salt lakes, and by mining rock salt, called halite. In 2009, world production was estimated at 260 million metric tons, the top five producers (in million tonnes) being China (60.0), United States (46.0), Germany (16.5), India (15.8) and Canada (14.0).[4]<br />
As well as the familiar uses of salt in cooking, salt is used in many applications, from manufacturing pulp and paper, to setting dyes in textiles and fabric, to producing soaps, detergents, and other bath products. It is the major source of industrial chlorine and sodium hydroxide, and used in almost every industry.<br />
Sodium chloride is sometimes used as a cheap and safe desiccant because it appears to have hygroscopic properties, making salting an effective method of food preservation historically; the salt draws water out of bacteria through osmotic pressure, keeping it from reproducing, a major source of food spoilage. Even though more effective desiccants are available, few are safe for humans to ingest.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>
<li style="background-color:#c3d2f0;"><p>Sodium chloride, also known as salt, common salt, table salt, or halite, is an ionic compound with the formula NaCl. Sodium chloride is the salt most responsible for the salinity of the ocean and of the extracellular fluid of many multicellular organisms. As the major ingredient in edible salt, it is commonly used as a condiment and food preservative<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>
<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p>Medical applications<br />
Sorbitol is used in bacterial culture media to distinguish the pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 from most other strains of E. coli as it is usually incapable of fermenting sorbitol, but 93% of known E. coli strains are capable of doing so. [4]<br />
Sorbitol, combined with kayexalate, helps the body rid itself of excess potassium ions in a hyperkalaemic state.[5] The kayexalate exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the bowel, while sorbitol helps to eliminate it.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Yellow_FCF">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Yellow_FCF</a> br />
<br />
Sunset Yellow FCF (also known as Orange Yellow S, FD&C Yellow 6 or C.I. 15985) is a synthetic yellow azo dye, manufactured from aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum. When added to foods, it is denoted by E Number E110. Although there are reports that it can induce an allergic reaction, this is not confirmed by scientific research.<br />
<br />
Sunset Yellow is useful in fermented foods which must be heat treated. <br />
It may be found in :<br />
orange sodas, orange jelly, marzipan, Swiss rolls, apricot jam, citrus marmalade, lemon curd, sweets, hot chocolate mix and packet soups, trifle mix, breadcrumbs, snack chips, cheese sauce mixes, and other products with artificial yellow, orange or red colours.<br />
<br />
Sunset Yellow is often used in conjunction with E123, Amaranth, in order to produce a brown colouring in both chocolates and caramel.[citation needed]<br />
<br />
At high concentrations, Sunset Yellow in solution with water undergoes a phase change from an isotropic liquid to a nematic liquid crystal. This occurs between 0.8 M and 0.9 M at room temperature.<br />
<br />
Sunset Yellow is a sulfonated version of Sudan I, a possible carcinogen,[citation needed] which is frequently present in it as an impurity. Sunset Yellow itself may be responsible for causing an allergic reaction in people with an aspirin intolerance, resulting in various symptoms including gastric upset, diarrhea, vomiting, nettle rash (urticaria) and swelling of the skin (angioedema). The colouring has also been linked to hyperactivity in young children.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

1.	Chemistry<br />
It is a synthetic dye produced using aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum. It can be combined with tartrazine to produce various shades of green. The dye is poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and 95% of the ingested dye can be found in the feces. It also reacts with certain bile pigments to form green feces.<br />
2.	Applications<br />
As a blue color, Brilliant Blue FCF is often found in ice cream, canned processed peas, dairy products, sweets and drinks. It is also used in soaps, shampoos, mouthwash and other hygiene and cosmetics applications. In soil science, Brilliant Blue is applied in tracing studies to visualize infiltration and water distribution in the soil.<br />
3.	Health and safety<br />
Brilliant Blue FCF has previously been banned in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland among others but has been certified as a safe food additive in the EU and is today legal in most of the countries. It has the capacity for inducing an allergic reaction in individuals with pre-existing moderate asthma. In the United States production exceeds 1 million pounds annually, and daily consumption is around 16 mg per person. It is one of the colorants that the Hyperactive Children's Support Group and the Feingold Association recommends to be eliminated from the diet of children. After extensive testing, the National Institutes of Health concluded that color additives do not cause hyperactivity.<br />

<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p>Brilliant Blue FCF (FD & C Blue No. 1) and Indigotine (FD & C Blue No. 2) were fed to groups of 24 Osborne-Mendel rats for two years at dietary levels of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0%. Growth inhibition occurred in the male animals fed Indigotine at the 2.0 and 5.0% levels. No effect was observed on survival, hematology, or organ weights. No significant pathologic changes were observed in animals fed either color.<br />
Five beagle dogs received a dietary level of 2.0%, and three dogs a level of 1.0% of Brilliant Blue FCF for one year. One dog died after 17 days on the 2% dietary level and another died after 46 weeks on the 1% level. Indigotine was fed to beagle dogs for periods up to two years at dietary levels of 1.0 and 2.0%. Four of the six dogs at the 2.0% level died during the two years, and one of the four at the 1.0% level was sacrificed in a moribund condition. All the deaths were attributed to intercurrent virus infections. No clinical signs, gross lesions, or microscopic pathology were attributed to intercurrent virus infections. No clinical signs, gross lesions, or microscopic pathology were attributed to ingestion of Brilliant Blue FCF or Indigotine; however, because of deaths from intercurrent virus infections a no-effect level has not been established for Indigotine.<br />
Subcutaneous injections of 30 mg of Brilliant Blue FCF or 20 mg of Indigotine into rats weekly for two years produced fibrosarcomas at the site of injection.<br />
Other than acute convulsive deaths of some of the test mice immediately after injection, no deleterious effects attributable to the weekly subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg of Indigotine were observed over a two-year period.<br />

<br />
Formaldehyde (systematic name: methanal) is an organic compound with the formula HCOH. As the simplest aldehyde, it is an important precursor to many other chemical compounds, especially for polymers. In 2005, annual world production of formaldehyde was estimated to be 23 million tons (50 billion pounds).In view of its widespread use, toxicity and volatility, exposure to formaldehyde is a significant consideration for human health.<br />
<br />
Formaldehyde is more complicated than many simple carbon compounds because it adopts different forms. Formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, but the gas readily converts to a variety of derivatives. These derivatives generally behave similarly to gaseous formaldehyde and are used in industry. One important derivative is the cyclic compound trioxane, the "trimer" of formaldehyde with formula is (HCOH)3. <br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

In addition to providing sweetness, it is an excellent humectant and texturizing agent. Sorbitol is about 60 percent as sweet as sucrose with one-third fewer calories. It has a smooth mouthfeel with a sweet, cool and pleasant taste. It is non-cariogenic and may be useful to people with diabetes. Sorbitol has been safely used in processed foods for almost half a century. It is also used in other products, such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.<br />
<br />
A French chemist first discovered sorbitol in the berries of the mountain ash in 1872. It occurs naturally in a wide variety of fruits and berries. Today it is commercially produced by the hydrogenation of glucose and is available in both liquid and crystalline form.<br />
<br />
Sorbitol has been affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved for use by the European Union and numerous countries around the world, including Australia, Canada and Japan.<br />
<br />
In the United States, sorbitol is provided by a number of manufacturers, including Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill Inc., Roquette America, Inc. and SPI Polyols, Inc.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>

Melamine<br />
Melamine is an organic base and a trimer of cyanamide, with a 1,3,5-triazine skeleton. Like cyanamide, it contains 66% nitrogen by mass and, if mixed with resins, has fire retardant properties due to its release of nitrogen gas when burned or charred, and has several other industrial uses. Melamine is also a metabolite of cyromazine, a pesticide. It is formed in the body of mammals who have ingested cyromazine. It has been reported that cyromazine can also be converted to melamine in plants.<br />
<br />
Melamine combines with cyanuric acid and related compounds to form melamine cyanurate and related crystal structures, which have been implicated as contaminants or biomarkers in Chinese protein adulterations.<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>
<li style="background-color:#ffe1a5;"><p>Rhodamine B (pronounced /ˈroʊdəmiːn/) is a chemical compound and a dye. It is often used as a tracer dye within water to determine the rate and direction of flow and transport. Rhodamine dyes fluoresce and can thus be detected easily and inexpensively with instruments called fluorometers. Rhodamine dyes are used extensively in biotechnology applications such as fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and ELISA.<br />
<br />
Rhodamine B is used in biology as a staining fluorescent dye, sometimes in combination with auramine O, as the auramine-rhodamine stain to demonstrate acid-fast organisms, notably Mycobacterium.<br />
<br />
Rhodamine B is tunable around 610 nm when used as a laser dye. Its luminescence quantum yield is 0.65 in basic ethanol, 0.49 in ethanol [3], 1.0 [4], and 0.68 in 94% ethanol. The fluorescence yield is temperature dependent.<br />

NEOTAME<br />
 	structure of neotame<br />
 <br />
IUPAC name	: (3R)-3-(3,3-Dimethylbutylamino)-4-[[(1R)<span class="break">&#8203;</span>-2-methoxy-2-oxo-1(phenylmethyl)ethyl]am<span class="break">&#8203;</span>ino]-4-oxobutanoic acid<br />
Properties Molecular formula 	: C20H30N2O5 <br />
Molar mass 			: 378.46 g/mol <br />
standard state			: (at 25 °C, 100 kPa)<br />
<br />
Neotame is an artificial sweetener made by NutraSweet that is between 7,000 and 13,000 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). In the European Union, it is known by the E number E961. Neotame is moderately heat stable and extremely potent. Neotame is rapidly metabolized and completely eliminated and does not accumulate in the body. <br />
The major metabolic pathway is hydrolysis of the methyl ester by esterases that are present throughout the body, which yields de-esterified neotame and methanol. Because only trace amounts of neotame are needed to sweeten foods, the amount of methanol derived from neotame is much lower than that found in common foods, such as fruit and vegetable juices. It has the characteristic aftertaste common to artificial sweeteners.<br />
The product is attractive to food manufacturers as its use greatly lowers the cost of production compared to using sugar or high fructose corn syrup (due to the lower quantities needed to achieve the same sweetening) while also benefitting the consumer by providing fewer "empty" sugar calories and a lower impact on blood sugar.<br />
It is chemically similar to the artificial sweetener aspartame but is used at vastly lower levels and is more stable. Chemically, it has a 3,3-dimethylbutyl group attached to the amino group of the aspartic acid portion of the molecule. Peptidases, which would typically break the peptide bond between the aspartic acid and phenylalanine moieties, are effectively blocked by the presence of the 3,3-dimethylbutyl moiety, thus reducing the production of phenylalanine, thereby making its consumption by those who suffer from phenylketonuria safe. <br />
Neotame was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for general use in July 2002 but is not yet widely used in food products. Neotame also is approved for use in Australia and New Zealand. Neotame is assigned the International Numbering System (INS) food additive code 961. <br />

MSG definitely can affect our body. A report from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) compiled in 1995 on behalf of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that MSG is safe for most people when “eaten at customary levels”. However, it also said that, based on anecdotal reports, some people may have an MSG intolerance that causes “MSG symptom complex” and/or a worsening of asthmatic symptoms. Subsequent research found that, while large doses of MSG given without food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent, not reproducible, and not observed when MSG was given with food. No statistical association has been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people convinced that they are sensitive to it. Adequately controlling for experimental bias includes a placebo-controlled double-blind experimental design and the application in capsules because of the strong and unique after-taste of glutamates. Studies looking into whether MSG causes obesity have given mixed results.<br />

As one of the enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by mutation during primate evolution, humans must obtain it from the diet; it is therefore a vitamin.[50] Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets.[51] Ascorbic acid is required for the conversion of the procollagen to collagen by oxidizing proline residues to hydroxyproline. In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins.[52][53] Ascorbic acid is redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide.[54] In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme ascorbate peroxidase, a function that is particularly important in stress resistance in plants.[55] Ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20 millimolar in chloroplasts.[56]<br />Nov. 17, 2010</p><span class="flag"><div style="line-height:0px; clear:both;" />&nbsp;</div></span><br clear="all"/><div class="clear"></div></li>
