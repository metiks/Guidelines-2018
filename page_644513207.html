<h2 style="color:">Basic Principles of Good Web Design</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<div class="rich_description" style="margin: 8px;"><p>Making a good website needs careful planning. It is more than just gathering relevant information, it requires special attention on selection, organization, and presentation of material as much as the research (or information) itself.</p>
<p>Your website should be                
  <strong>CLEAR </strong>and                
  <strong>INTERESTING </strong>for your reader. Without both of it, you will lose your audiences.
</p>
<p>Take a look at this site       
  <a href="http://climatechangedebate.wikispaces.com">climatechangedebate.wikispaces.com</a> to give you an idea of what your website project should look like.
</p>
<p>Here are guidelines to get you moving on</p>

  <li>Site Layout</li>
  <li>The Front door</li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>

<h2 style="color:">Before you begin</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<p class="description">Consider your goals and your audience. You should have a clear sense of who will be using your site. Remember that you required to present your recommendation to one of these audiences (the public, the government officials or food manufacturers).<br />
What exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Why is this important?<br />

<h2 style="color:">Site Layout</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<p class="description">* Strive for consistency. <br />
Plan a unique identity for your site, this means the pages in your project should have a common feel: there should be consistency among backgrounds, color schemes, navigational tools, and tone of voice (formal vs casual language). This is especially important because you need to divide your site's pages among several team members. Without consistency, your pages will seem like two or three separate projects lumped together, rather than a single, unified whole.<br />
<br />
* Provide easy navigation of links within your site. <br />
Audience should easily move around your website without being confused. You should consider including a prominent 'home' link or icon on each page and highlighted links within textual material to related information elsewhere on the site. <br />
<br />
* Don't hide important information. <br />
Users don't like to click too many times to find the information they want -- if information is particularly important, make it accessible up front. See the National Geographic Website for a good example.<br />

<h2 style="color:">The Front Door</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<div class="rich_description" style="margin: 8px;"><p>* Give your site a descriptive title. 
  <br/>Your title should convey the content of your site in a concise manner. You can also consider using pictures banners apart from text as the gateway to your site. Ideally, it should arouse the curiosity of users and prompt them to explore your project pages.
  <br/>
  <br/>* Include a brief introduction. 
  <br/>This should be part of your site's home page, and should explain the scope and purpose of the site. Audience will expect some elaboration of your title, a brief paragraph or two describing what the site is all about and what makes it interesting. Also include easy navigational links to all your pages from this homepage

<h2 style="color:">Accessibility</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<div class="rich_description" style="margin: 8px;"><p>*  Make sure your text is legible.
  <br/>Legible means easy to read, check the size, color, and font of all text within your site to confirm that. Be especially careful of dark or fancy backgrounds that make text hard to read.
</p>
<p>* Avoid text-only pages. 
  <br/>Ideally, a user should never encounter an entire screen full of uninterrupted text in browsing your site.
</p>
<p>* Don't sacrifice elegance for pizzazz. 
  <br/>Just because you can make images fly across the screen does not mean you necessarily should. Every design element of your site (colors, images, animation) ought to correspond thematically with the content and goals of your project.
</p>
<p>* Provide a link for every URL you mention in your site. 
  <br/>If your bibliography or notes include a citation for another website, list the URL in full, but make it 'clickable' as well so that the user can go directly to the site in question.
</p>
<p>* Consider the needs of your viewers. 
  <br/>Think about the bandwidth your site will require. Keep in mind that not all users will have the luxury of high-speed internet connection. Minimize the memory requirements of your site by reducing the size of images and other large files.

<h2 style="color:">The Final Countdown</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<div class="rich_description" style="margin: 8px;"><p>Thoroughly test your site. Ask a friend to sit down and explore your site. Watch them navigate the site. Do they get lost? Do they have trouble finding links? Do they have trouble understanding your labels? Make sure there are no broken links on your site</p>
